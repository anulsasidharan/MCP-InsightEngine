# MCP-InsightEngine

## Project Overview

**MCP-InsightEngine** is a **large language model (LLM)-based file analysis and insight generation tool** built using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It intelligently analyzes structured and unstructured files (CSV, JSON, PDF, and text) to extract **actionable insights**, detect anomalies, and generate summaries. This project demonstrates expertise in **AI/ML pipeline development, LLM integration, and scalable data intelligence**.

## ðŸ§© High-Level Architecture

- At its core, the MCP-InsightEngine comprises several key components:

- **MCP Server (mcp_server.py)**: Acts as the central server that listens for incoming requests from AI clients.

- **Parser (parser.py)**: Handles the interpretation of incoming data, ensuring it's in a format that the server can process.

- **Insights Engine (insights.py)**: Processes the parsed data to extract meaningful insights or perform specific actions.

- **Visualizer (visualizer.py)**: Generates visual representations of the insights for easier understanding and analysis.

## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

- **Client Request**: An AI client sends a request to the MCP server, typically in the form of an HTTP request.

- **Parsing**: The parser.py module processes the incoming request, extracting relevant data and converting it into a structured format.

- **Insight Generation**: The structured data is passed to the insights.py module, which analyzes it to generate insights or perform actions.

- **Visualization**: The visualizer.py module takes the generated insights and creates visual representations, such as graphs or charts.

- **Response**: The visualizations and insights are sent back to the AI client as a response.
